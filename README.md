# PyLexis

`PyLexis` is a tool to easily plot Lexis Diagrams within Python. It is based on [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and inspirated in 
[LexisPlotR](https://github.com/ottlngr/LexisPlotR).

### What is a Lexis Diagram?

> In demography a Lexis diagram (named after economist and social scientist Wilhelm Lexis) is a two dimensional diagram that is used to represent events 
(such as births or deaths) that occur to individuals belonging to different cohorts. Calendar time is usually represented on the horizontal axis, while 
age is represented on the vertical axis. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexis_diagram>)
